An Open Source Coloring Book About Distributed Systems

## Open Source Software and Hardware
Not all of us think about a coloring book when we talk about Open Source Hardware. It's a physical object made by human processes! Just like a microchip!

Not quite.

## Open Source Art
Copyright and Intellectual Property are complicated subjects. The [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) offers a number of Open Licenses for distributing something like the source code to a coloring book. I happen to like `cc-by-sa-4.0` but that might limit the ability of some people to contribute to a collaborative open source project.

## Open Source Decisions
This is intended as a git project for beginners. There are a lot of tools to navigate when producing media even as simple as a coloring book. Open Source Projects are built by the people who show up, and they show up for a lot of different reasons.
